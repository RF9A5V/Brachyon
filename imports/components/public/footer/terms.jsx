            copyright or have legal access to the material. Any material deemed
            inappropriate (vulgar, obscene, profane, threatening, or invasive of privacy

        <h2>Account</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          <span>
            You are responsible for the safeguarding of your account information such
            as your password and email. Brachyon is not responsible for any losses or
            damages resulting from a compromised password. It is encouraged that you
            keep a strong password and do not give away your information to any other
            third party. You are responsible for any activity on your account. At any
            point of time Brachyon reserves the right to terminate your account.

        <h2>Event Creation Service</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          <span>
            At any time Brachyon can terminate a created event. Reasons for doing so
            may be (but not limited to) for any of the following: Request by the owner
            of the intellectual property the tournament is held for, display of
            inappropriate material, termination of account of event holders, violation
            of other terms, violation of local or federal law, or repeated failure to
            meet with promised timeline.
          </span>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          <span>
            For any crowdfunded event you must agree to a timeline detailing out the
            time limit for which the funding takes place, the time in which the
            tournament is held, and when the prizes for the tournaments are released.
            Agreeing to this timeline is paramount to the trust between Brachyon and the
            crowdfunders and failure to comply can result in mandatory refund to the
            backers and potentially termination of your account. Funding for the
            tournament can continue given that the goal is met until a week prior to
            the date of the tournament's launch.
          </span>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          <span>
            At the end of the goal, 5% of the overall goal will be collected by Brachyon
            during the transfer process to the creator including any further pledges
            past the goal.
          </span>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>Crowdfunding</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          <span>
            When promising certain amounts of funds to an event, you will be charged
            when funding for the tournament ends given it met its goal. If the event
            fails to reach its goal then no money will be taken nor used elsewhere.
            At any time you are allowed to cancel your pledge into a tournament prior
            to the end of the funding stage. For any stretch goals or rewards you may
            be required to answer questions such as mailing address and country to
            receive them.
          </span>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          <span>
            After the funding stage of a tournament, refunds are done through Stripe.
            Tournament quality cannot be guaranteed by Brachyon but by the event creator.
            Any and all payments after the pledge will be collected immediately and is
            under the same rules of refunding as any cash collected by the end of the
            goal.
          </span>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Tournament Management Software</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          <span>
            Access to the tournament management software is free to use and does not
            require an account, although guarantee of saving the information of the
            tournament requires an account. Tournament progress can be linked to a
            created event and tracked from there. Other viewers along with third party
            websites can receive and track progress of a tournament at any given time.
          </span>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          <span>
            If set up to do so, you can link your account toward a tournament to record
            your statistics onto your account. This process requires the confirmation of
            both the tournament manager and the user account itself. Anyone viewing the
            tournament including third party websites can view your account from the
            tournament page unless you choose to opt out. Some tournaments may require
            you to link your account or may not allow linking.
          </span>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Costs of Service</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          <span>
            Tournament management, account creation, event participation, and event
            creation without crowdfunding are free to use for any user. 5% of money
            from crowdfunding will be taken for us given the event meets its goal, and
            5% of the money funded afterward will also be charged. If using rewards or
            stretch goals provided by other companies the company may take their own
            cut as well. The size is up to the discretion of the company. A small
            percent is required to be payed to Stripe for ticketing, it is up to the
            event creators' discretion for whether the creator will pay it or the
            participants will pay it.
